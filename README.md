# LuaJIT-Gamma
Gamma wrapper

# Python
* all these wrappers will work with python with some changes I just dont want to support it
* I compile them and test them with python and use them 
* sometimes python is better than Lua for alot of things



# Hmmm
* Didn't really work how I had wanted it to
* I am continuing with it but combining them all into a single interface later
